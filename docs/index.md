# Welcome to CSUF's Astronomy 101

These lecture notes and tutorials correspond to the asynchronous online version of ASTR101 at California State University Fullerton.

The Modules contain notes from the images and text of the recorded lecture presentations. 

The Activities go through questions to check your understanding, activities to work through to practice applying these ideas, and discussion topics for your group.
