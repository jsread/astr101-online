# Seasonal Stars

We'll learn about annual changes in the night sky

## Why do we see different stars in different months?

Right (Winter): A sight line from Orion’s Belt points downward to Sirius in Canis Major, the brightest night star.](img/summer-stars-and-winter-stars.png)

We have to face away from the Sun to see stars.

* The stars are always present in the sky

* Light from the Sun and atmosphere obscures different stars at different times of the year

* The constellations visible at a particular time of night change as we orbit the Sun

    * Example: Orion is visible in the winter, but not the summer


[Constellations on the Ecliptic. The Sun is drawn at the center. Surrounding the Sun is a blue circular arrow indicating the path of the Earth around the Sun. The Earth is shown in two positions along this arrow, representing where is it located in June and August. Surrounding the circle of the Earth the constellations of the ecliptic are drawn. Counter-clockwise from top center are: Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Ophiuchus, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus. The Earth's vantage point is illustrated with an arrow drawn from the Earth through the center of the Sun to the constellation behind the Sun as seen from Earth. In June the arrow points to Taurus, in August to Cancer.]()


### Astrology aside

- Sun sign astrology refers to the position of the Sun at your birth, within one of the twelve zodiac signs. 

- There is no scientific mechanism for how the apparent position of the stars and planets could affect your daily life.
