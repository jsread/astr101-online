# The Sky Around the World


## Northern and Southern Skies

Your view of space depends on where you stand.

![Two views of earth, one tilted to show North America, one tilted to show South America. Speeeh bubbles from each show images of the constellation Orion, but they are flipped vertically compared to each other.](img/northern-southern-sky.png)

Think back to the features of our [Celestial Sphere Model](celestial_sphere.md#features-of-the-celestial-sphere-model).

<quiz>
Where on Earth would you stand to see Polaris at your Zenith?

- [x] The North Pole
- [ ] The South Pole
- [ ] The Equator
- [ ] Fullerton, CA

The North Celestial Pole is directly above Earth's North Pole. Polaris, at the NCP, will be directly overhead, at your Zenith, if you stand at the North Pole.

Where on Earth would you stand to see Polaris on your horizon?

- [] The North Pole
- [ ] The South Pole
- [x] The Equator
- [ ] Fullerton, CA

On Earth's equator, you see the Celestial Equator passing through your Zenith. The Celestial Poles are 90 degrees to the side, so are seen on your Horizon.

## Latitude

Your view of the sky depends on latitude.


Latitude is used to describe locations on Earth.

![An image of the earth with three latitudes highlighted. The equator is around the middle and is labeled 0 degrees N. A parallel arc through Fullerton is labeled 34 degrees N. The arctic circle circles closer to the North Pole and is labeled 66 degrees N. ](img/latitude.jpg)


At a given latitude, the celestial pole is **that latitude angle** above the horizon in your local sky.

![Three diagrams show the apparent motion of stars as seen by observers at different Earth latitudes. (a) At the North Pole, the North Celestial Pole is at the Zenith and stars move in circles around it, never rising or setting. (b) At the Equator, the North Celestial Pole lies on the horizon and all stars rise in the east and set in the west. (c) In the Northern Hemisphere, the North Celestial Pole is above the horizon; stars near it circle without setting, while others rise and set.](img/OSC_Astro_02_01_Star.jpg)

At a given latitude, you can have a mixture of [types of star](celestial_sphere.md#types-of-stars):

* Circumpolar stars - never set below the horizon (e.g. Polaris for us)
* Rise and set stars - rise in the east and set in the west (e.g. Betegeuse for us) 
* Never rise stars - never rise above the horizon (e.g. the Southern Cross for us)

Everyone at a given latitude sees the stars the same way.

<quiz>
The night-long photo exposure above was taken (near the top of a mountain) in what location?

- [ ]  Near the one of the Poles
- [x]   Near the Equator
- [ ]  Near the middle latitude (45°) of one of the hemispheres

Since the celestial pole is on the horizon, it was taken from near the equator (from Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.)
</quiz>

<quiz>
At what location would **all** visible stars be circumpolar?

- [x]  The North Pole
- [ ]  The Equator
- [ ] Sydney,  Australia
- [ ] Fullerton,  CA

If the celestial pole is at your Zenith, all the stars will circle it and won't cross the horizon.

## Sky Motion and Latitude

How does latitude affect star motion?

![Two observers stand on the top of green spheres. One is labeled Northern Hemisphere and one Southern Hemisphere. A celestial sphere around the northern hemisphere shows counter-clockwise rotation, then flips over to the southern hemisphere showing clockwise rotation](img/Northern-to-Southern.gif)

* Stars appear to rotate counter-clockwise around the North Celestial Pole 
* Stars appear to rotate clockwise around the South Celestial Pole. 
* Rise and set stars always rise in the East and set in the West.
* All these motions come from the rotation of the Celestial Sphere.
    * **Really**, the rotation of the Earth

In the Northern Hemisphere, the North Celestial pole is seen in the Northern sky.

This video shows how the stars move as seen in the Northern Hemisphere, looking in different directions.

- Stars appear to rotate counter-clockwise 
around the North Celestial Pole.
- Rise and set star paths are tilted to the South 
in Northern Hemisphere; stars move from East to West.

This next video shows how the stars move as seen in the Southern Hemisphere.

- The South Celestial pole is seen in the Southern sky.

- In the Southern Hemisphere, stars appear to rotate clockwise around the South Celestial Pole.

- Rise and set star paths are tilted to the North in the  Southern Hemisphere; stars still move from East to West.

- All these motions come from the rotation of the Earth.



## Summary of Star Motion
- Stars appear in fixed patterns on the Celestial Sphere.
- The Celestial Sphere appears to rotate around the Earth once every day. 
- Every star completes a full circle every 24 hours.
- Stars appear to rotate counter-clockwise around North Celestial Pole and clockwise around South Celestial Pole. 
- Rise and set stars always rise in the East and set in the West.
