# Daily Motion of the Sky

We'll discuss how Earth's spin causes the motion we see, and how the sun and stars appear to move.

The [Celestial Sphere Model](celestial_sphere.md) describes what we see but isn't how things really are.

## What Causes Daily Motion?

Earth is spinning.

This is a Galileo satellite time-lapse movie of Earth 
starting 6AM PST, December 11 1990, from
2,000,000 km away. The movie covers 25 hours.

- Earth’s motion changes our view of space.

- When looking at objects in the sky, two of our own motions change what we see:
    - The daily rotation of the Earth about its axis
    - The annual revolution (orbit) of the Earth around the Sun

- Earth’s orbit is slow compared to its daily rotation. We don’t notice it hour-to-hour.

### Earth's rotation

![An image of earth, with lines extending from North and South Poles. Curved arrows arc around the Earth and its poles showng rotation from west to east](img/rotation1.png)

- The Earth rotates from west to east
- This makes the celestial sphere appear to rotate around us from east to west
- It makes a full rotation every 24 hours (*23 hours 56 minutes compared to background stars*)

### Observing from a rotating Earth

- Most objects in our Solar System move slowly compared to this daily rotation.
- More distant objects are too far away to see any motion.
- For most celestial objects, the motion you see in the sky is daily motion from the Earth’s rotation
    - stars, galaxies, the Sun, the Moon, the planets, passing comets…
- Exceptions: rapidly-moving nearby objects like meteors (shooting stars) and satellites


## The Path of the Sun

This composite image follows the Sun's path through the sky the December solstice day of 2005 in Italy. The view covers about 115 degrees side to side in 43 seperate exposures from sunrise to sunset.

* The Sun, Moon, and planets also appear to lie on the Celestial Sphere

* Over the course of one day, they appear almost fixed with respect to the stars in the Celestial Sphere

* The Celestial Sphere appears to carry the Sun, Moon, and planets around the Earth once per day (24 hours) 

* The real motion is Earth’s rotation

This timelapse shows the motion of the Sun from sunrise to sunset:

The Sun's path is similar to Star B in our previous Local Sky example:

![A dome of the sky over the ground. East is to the back, West to front, North to left, South to right on the horizon. Polaris is on the upper left edge, above Noth. The Celestial Equator and Star Path A arc from East, up the back of the dome to high in the South, down the front of the dome to West. Star Path B makes a loop on the dome, from low above North, up the back of the dome to the Zenith, down the front of the dome to its original point.](img/local-sky-example.jpg)

* The daily motion of the Sun is just like a rise-and-set star

* The Sun’s daily motion is from Earth’s rotation

* The sun is highest around noon. In Fullerton, it is never at the zenith.

## The Sun and Stars

When the Sun is above the horizon, our sky changes.

The stars are always there, but we can’t see them during the daytime because of scattered sunlight.

A local sky at Noon, facing South, with atmosphere:
![Local sky facing south. The Sun is high in the blue sky. Venus is labeled but cannot be seen.](img/sky-noon-atmosphere.jpg)

The same local sky at Noon, facing South, without atmosphere:
![Local sky facing south. The Sun is high in the black night-like sky. Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars are all shown, along with bright stars Altair and Fomalhaut, and other dimmer stars.](img/sky-noon-no-atmosphere.jpg)


Over one day, the sun and stars move together from East to West on the celestial sphere.

Observing the stars before sunrise, and after sunset, we can determine what constellation (region of the Celestial Sphere) the Sun appears in.

How much time has passed in this animation?

![Stars in a rotating local sky. The most prominent star starts high in the sky, loops under the horizon following its circle path, and returns to its original place.](../img/star-video-1.gif)

- [x] One day
- [ ] One week 
- [ ] One month 
- [ ] One year 

The stars make a full circle in the sky, appearing to rotate around the Celestial Pole. This means that 24 hours, or one day, has passed.

</quiz>


<quiz>

About how much time has passed in this animation?

![Stars in a rotating local sky. The most prominent star starts on its path highest in the sky, and moves to the farthest west side of its circle path.](../img/star-video-2.gif)

- [ ] 3 hours
- [x] 6 hours 
- [ ] 12 hours 
- [ ] 24 hours 

The stars make about a quarter of their circle. This means that one quarter of 24 hours has passed. 24 hours divided by 4 is 6 hours.

<quiz>

Which star is above the horizon for the greatest amount of time?

![Two stars follow circular paths around Polaris. Star A is shown to the right of Polaris on a larger circle that dips underneath the horizon. Star B is shown to the left of Polaris on a smaller circle that is entirely above the horizon.](../img/sky-circles-1.jpg)

- [ ] Star A
- [X] Star B

Star B is circumpolar, it is above the horizon for 24 hours every day.

<quiz>

Which star is above the horizon for the greatest amount of time?

![Two stars follow circular paths around the SCP. Star A is shown up and to the right of Polaris on a smaller circle that is mostly underneath the horizon. Star B is shown to the right of Polaris on a larger circle that arcs above the smaller circle.](../img/sky-circles-2.jpg)

- [ ] Star A
- [x] Star B

Each circle path takes 24 hours. A bigger fraction of B's circle is above the horizon, so it spends a greater part of its time above the horizon.

</quiz>

<quiz>
How much time is there between when a star rises and when the star sets?

- [ ]  less than 12 hours
- [ ]   about 12 hours
- [ ]  more than 12 hours
- [x] it depends on the star 

Depending on the star's path, the time above the horizon changes. Some stars spend 24 hours above the horizon and never set.

<quiz>
You observe <s>a star</s> the Sun rising due East. When the <s>star</s>  Sun reaches its highest position above the horizon, where will it be?

- [ ] High in the Northern sky
- [ ] High in the Eastern sky
- [x] High in the Southern sky
- [ ] High in the Western sky
- [ ]  At the Zenith

This sun is like Star A in [Example Star Paths](#example-star-paths).
