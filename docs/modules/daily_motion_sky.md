# Daily Motion of the Sky

We'll discuss what causes Daily motion, how different stars appear to move, and how the local sky looks different from different locations on Earth.

## What Causes Daily Motion

Earth is spinning.

This is a Galileo satellite time-lapse movie of Earth 
starting 6AM PST, December 11 1990, from
2,000,000 km away. The movie covers 25 hours.

- Earth’s motion changes our view of space.
- When looking at objects in the sky, two of our own motions change what we see:
    - The daily rotation of the Earth about its axis
    - The annual revolution (orbit) of the Earth around the Sun
- Earth’s orbit is slow compared to its daily rotation. We don’t notice it hour-to-hour.

### Characteristics of rotation

- The Earth rotates from west to east
- This makes the celestial sphere appear to rotate around us from east to west
- It makes a full rotation every 24 hours (*23 hours 56 minutes compared to background stars*)

### Observing from a rotating Earth

- Most objects in our Solar System move slowly compared to this daily rotation.
- For most celestial objects, the main motion you see is daily motion from the Earth’s rotation
    - stars, galaxies, the Sun, the Moon, the planets, passing comets…
- Exceptions: rapidly-moving nearby objects like meteors (shooting stars) and satellites
