## Discussion

Lots of people have worked to try and understand the size and scale of Astronomy. Choose and watch one of the videos listed here, and share something interesting you learned with your dicsussion pod.

* [Powers of Ten™ (1977) by Eames Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)
Powers of Ten takes us on an adventure in magnitudes.  Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this famous film transports us to the outer edges of the universe, returns to Earth, and ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.
* [Solar System Size and Distance by NASAJPL Edu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMZ5WFRbSTc) How big are the planets and how far away are they compared to each other? See how the sizes of planets and the distances between them compare. And find out why it's so hard to create a scale model of the solar system that accurately represents both size and distance on a single screen or the page of a book.
* [How Far Away is the Moon? (The Scale of the Universe) by Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz9D6xba9Og) If the Earth were the size of a basketball and the moon a tennis ball, how far apart would they be? Diagrams that are not to scale make us think that they're closer than they really are.
