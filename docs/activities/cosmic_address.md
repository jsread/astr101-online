A galaxy is...

- [ ] A large, glowing ball of gas powered by nuclear energy.
- [ ] A relatively small and icy object orbiting a star.
- [x] A collection of a few hundred million to a trillion or more stars, bound together by gravity
- [ ] A system consiting of one to a few stars, orbited by planets, moons, and smaller objects.

A galaxy is a collection of stars.

A small icy orbit orbiting a star would be a comet; a glowing ball powered by nuclear energy would be a star; a system of stars orbited by planets and other objects is a planetary system like our solar system.

Where does the Andromeda Galaxy fit in the organizational diagram below?

![Three nested regions. (A) Solar System is inside (B) Milky Way is inside (C) Universe](../img/organizational-diagram-universe.png)

- [ ] Solar System 
- [ ] Milky Way
- [x] Universe

Andromdeda and the Milky Way are two seperate galaxies. They are both in the Universe.

Where does the star Vega fit in the organizational diagram below?

![Three nested regions. (A) Solar System is inside (B) Milky Way is inside (C) Universe](../img/organizational-diagram-universe.png)

- [ ] Solar System 
- [x] Milky Way
- [ ] Universe

Vega is one of the stars we see in the night sky. All these individual stars are part of the Milky Way.

Where does Earth's Moon fit in the organizational diagram below?

![Three nested regions. (A) Solar System is inside (B) Milky Way is inside (C) Universe](../img/organizational-diagram-universe.png)

- [x] Solar System 
- [ ] Milky Way
- [ ] Universe

The Moon is part of the Solar System, since it orbits Earth which orbits the Sun.

Astronomers can only observe events that happened in the past. This is because

- [ ] It takes time to process telescope data.
- [x] The speed of light is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second.
- [ ] The Universe is 14 billion years old.
- [ ] Our telescopes are not yet large enough.

Astronomers can only see the universe using messengers like light, which take time to travel to us. The farther away something is, the longer it has been since the light we see left from that object.

The farthest known object imaged is the galaxy MoM-z14. The light from this galaxy has travelled for 13.5 billion light years to maket this. If the Universe is 13.8 billion years old, that means we observe MoM-z14 as it was ____ years after the Universe began.

![A small red splotch labeled MoM-z14](../img/MoM-z14_Naidu_et_al._2025.png)


- [x] 300 million
- [ ] 13.5 billion
- [ ] 13.8 billion
- [ ] 27.3 billion

Light from MoM-z14 has been travelling for 13.4 billion years. The time the light left is the *gap* between the the total age of the universe and the travel time. The difference is 13.8 billion - 13.5 billion = 0.3 billion = 300 million. So, the light must have left MoM-z14 300 million years after the Universe began.

## Discussion

Lots of people have worked to try and understand the size and scale of objects in Astronomy. Choose one of the links listed here to, and share something interesting you learned with your dicsussion pod.

*  [Scale of the Solar System Demo (web page)](http://www.phrenopolis.com/perspective/solarsystem/) This page shows a scale model of the solar system. The Sun and planets are shown in corresponding scale. Unlike most models, which are compressed for viewing convenience, the planets here are also shown at their true-to-scale average distances from the Sun. That makes this page rather large - on an ordinary 72 dpi monitor it's just over half a mile wide.
* [Powers of Ten™ (1977) by Eames Office (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)
Powers of Ten takes us on an adventure in magnitudes.  Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this famous film transports us to the outer edges of the universe, returns to Earth, and ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.
* [Solar System Size and Distance by NASAJPL Edu (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMZ5WFRbSTc) How big are the planets and how far away are they compared to each other? See how the sizes of planets and the distances between them compare. And find out why it's so hard to create a scale model of the solar system that accurately represents both size and distance on a single screen or the page of a book.
* [How Far Away is the Moon? (The Scale of the Universe) by Veritasium (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz9D6xba9Og) If the Earth were the size of a basketball and the moon a tennis ball, how far apart would they be? Diagrams that are not to scale make us think that they're closer than they really are.
