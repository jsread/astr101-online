![A dome-shaped local sits above the horizon, with Earth at the center and Earth’s equator marked. The north celestial pole and North Star are indicated along the tilted rotation axis. Arrows indicate the direction of celestial sphere rotation, and dashed lines illustrate the stars’ circular paths around the celestial pole. Two example stars (Star A and Star B) trace curved paths across the sky. Star B traces a  circular path from the back of the dome (1), the zenith (2), front of dome (3), and above the horizon directly below the North star. Star A follows a larger circle from the farthest point of the horizon (1), to high on the rightmost edge of the dome (2), to the front point of the horizon(3), to down below the horizon (4).](img/motion-tutorial-fig2.png)

If there was no atmosphere, this image shows the sky at noon:

![Local sky view facing south. The horizon is labeled East on the left, South at center, and West on the right. In the sky, the constellations Libra (low in the eastern sky), Virgo (higher toward the southeast), Leo (high in the southern sky, Cancer (to the southwest), and Gemini (low in the western sky) are drawn with stick-figure star patterns and labels. The Sun appears within Leo's boundaries. ](img/sky-noon-leo.png)

- [x]  Leo
- [ ] Gemini
- [ ]  Libra
