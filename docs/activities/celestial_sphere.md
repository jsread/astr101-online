## Discussion

Chose an astronomical object you can see easily in the sky today - the Sun, the Moon, a bright star, perhaps one of the planets ([Planets visible in your sky tonight](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/).) Observe it **twice**, ideally half an hour to a few hours apart.

1. Describe its location in the sky using our categories for Altitude and Azimuth in the [Celestial Module](../modules/celestial_sphere.md).
2. Describe any change in location from one time to another.
3. Based on your observation, does this object behave like it is fixed on the Celestial Sphere? Why or why not?
